# Travel Itinerary Planner - AI Prompts Documentation

This document lists the main prompts used for Google Gemini AI integration in the Travel Itinerary Planner project.

---

## 1. Activity Generation Prompt
Used to generate activities based on user notes/interests when creating or editing a trip.

```
You are a travel planner. The user is visiting {trip.destination}.
User notes / interests: {trip.notes}
Give more weight to user notes when generating activities.

Generate a list of 6-9 activities with:
- name
- category (Culture, Nature, Food, Leisure, Shopping)
- duration in hours
- location (city area)
- ensure all fields are present
- return at least 6 activities
- ensure that the response is valid JSON
Return JSON only:
[{"name": "...", "category": "...", "duration": 2, "location": "..."}]
```

## 2. Schedule Generation Prompt
Used to generate a day-by-day itinerary from selected activities.

```
You are a professional travel planner.

Trip: {trip.destination}, {trip.num_days} days
Activities:
{activity_list}

Your task:
1. Distribute activities across {trip.num_days} days logically.
2. Group activities that are close by (by location).
3. Mix categories reasonably.
4. Max 8 hours/day.
5. If {trip.num_days} equals number of activities, assign one per day.
6. Return TWO sections:

SCHEDULE:
JSON object, keys=day numbers, values=list of activity names in order.

JUSTIFICATION:
Explain in 2–3 lines per day why these activities were grouped.
```

## 3. Edit Schedule (Unassigned Activities) Prompt
Used to assign days to activities that have not yet been manually assigned.

```
You are a smart travel planner. I have a trip to {trip.destination} for {trip.num_days} days.
Here are unassigned activities (name, category, duration, location):
{activity_list}

Constraints:
- Max 8 hours/day
- Group nearby activities together
- Mix categories evenly
- Return JSON with day numbers as keys and list of activity names
```

## Notes
- Prompts are dynamically formatted with trip details and activity lists.
- Responses are parsed as JSON and used to update the itinerary in the database.
- Prompts can be further refined for improved AI results.
